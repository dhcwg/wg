There is a planned joint DHC/sunset4 session planned in Berlin to discuss
issues that overlap Sunset4 and DHC. (Sunset4 and DHC will have separate
sessions as well)

IPR Disclosure
by Ted Lemon

Ted: Important procedural thing to be aware of. Announcing that there was a late
IPR disclosure.  In 2008 first secure-dhcpv6 draft was published. In 2010 there
was a patent filed. The IPR was disclosed in 2013 after WGLC. That is not ok
according to BCP79. IETF participants are required to required to disclose IPR
as soon as they are aware of any IP claims. The section chosen is a formal
notification sent to the list.

DHCP Directorate
by Ted Lemon

Ted: The issue is that DHC is an attractive place for people defining options
that have really nothing to do with DHCP. This often forces the WG to take up
the work that is not really DHCP. The proposal is to take it off the charter.
The DHC will no longer produce DHCP options. The work would be done in the
respective WGs. For example DHCP option for PCP is done in PCP WG. DHC is going
to do only protocol extensions. We're going to form DHCP Directorate - a
collection of experts that will help AD, mostly by doing review for DHCP related
work in other WGs. Architectural questions remain in DHC (option guidelines,
leasequery, failover, DHCPv4-over-IPv6 etc.). Chairs will propose DHCP
Directorate charter. Ted will be responsible for nominating members of DHCP
Directorate.

Bernie Volz: Maybe call it DHCP Options Directorate?
Ted: No, it may be for other things, not just options.
Kim Kinnear: Directorate not a bad idea in general, but there will be an overlap
between WG and directorate.
Ted: One of the major reasons for having WG is to form a consensus. Directorate
is more about technical review than consensus.
Kim: Would you expect more than one person to do review?
Ted: There may be couple people requested to do review.
Kim: My concern is that if we decide to solve a problem and the problem is not
protocol specific, what do we do?
Ted: Give me an example?
Kim: I don't have one right now. New suboption for option 82 for example.
Ted: If there is no WG that is appropriate and there's a genuine need for it,
we have liason statement from cablelabs or something like that.
Kim: What if we 12 people decide in this room that we need an option?
Ted: Good question. If there's 12 people interested, there are 2 options. The
first one is to create new charter, the second is to form a new WG. Another
way is to go to your AD and do individual submission and go straight to IESG.
Kim: In that case I object. I think this is a bad idea.
Bernie: We'll take it to the list.
Sheng Jiang: There is another scenario in IETF - do gap analysis or requirements
document. What if DHC gets a requirements document from some other WG. Would it
be ok to do this work in DHC?
Ted: No. This is an attractive nuisance. The whole point is to remove that
attractive nuisance.
Sheng: In the ops group expresses a need for an option to handle some
operational scenario, where should the work go?
Ted: That's a good point. I don't have an answer for that right now. I probably
need to discuss this with Ralph Droms. If it were completely up to me, I'd say
wait for a case like that and then decide, but I hear you. This is a legitimate
concern. Let me think about that.

Obtaining IPv4 Parameters in IPv6 Networks
by Ted Lemon
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration-01
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6-05
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sun-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-v4config-00

Bernie: We'd like to take up only couple clarifying questions, Ian will present
next on similar topic and Ole will do his. After that we'll have a broader
discussion later.

Suresh Krishnan: It is difficult to foresee how many options will be needed in
the next 10 or 20 years.

Rajiv: I just wanted to clarify that MAP-E was presented. It is not just the
part of PD used to derive IPv4 address, but also IPv4 prefix is provisioned.

draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration
presented by Ian Farrer
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration-01
http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/86/slides/slides-86-dhc-4.pptx

Ian presented 3 different approaches discussed in the draft: DHCPv4-over-IPv6,
DHCPv6 and hybrid approach (DHCPv6 to get IPv4 address and then request any
other IPv4 options using DHCPINFORM over softwire tunnel).

DHCPv6 through Tunels
presented by Ole Troan
draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv6-tunnel

This is opposite of the previously discussed options. DHCPv6 client working over
IPv4 networks. The problem is to run DHCPv6 client on interface that does not have
link-local interface and doesn't support multicast. Possible solutions are: a)
integrate relay with client b) allow client-server communication using global
address (with solving the problem of how the client can learn server address).

Ted: We had discussion on mailing list: do we colocate relay with client or "break
the protocol" and allow unicast? 
Tomek: Is it solicit or information-request only?
Ted: good point. inf-request only. The point in not allowing clients unicast packets
to server to break down every client that attempts to do it.
Bernie: Agree.
Ted: I'm tempted to suggest: have the client just send relay-forw message.
Ralph Droms: Didn't we go though this before for some other technology?
(unaudible): NEMO!
Francis Dupont: There's RFC6276, which exactly solves the same problem for mobile
router. The solution was to colocate relay with the client.
Ole: So we can kill this document.
Bernie: That's brillant. Thanks, Ralph!
(laughs)

Discussion regarding DHCPv4 over IPv6 networks
Ted: My expectation and hope about this is that we find a nuanced solution, not a sledgehammer.
Kim Kinnear: Are we trying to pick one of the solution or some variant of thereof?
Ted: We are not trying to pick one of 3 choices. I think the solution to the problem is 
to do just information request. BTW the ideal environment for this is that you don't have
any IPv4 services left. If your provide has IPv6 only network, you are not supposed to need
any information about IPv4 services. We're configuring CPE here. CPE can provide DNS over
IPv4 to end hosts, but talk IPv6 upstream.
Ian: We did a lot of work in Softwires to find provisioning methods and the way it is constructed
now is to use a single container. If we chose to break that down, it will put us back a long way.
Ted: We talked about only stateless here. When talking about unified cpe case is one of:
a) you get just this and this will be enough or b) you're doing stateful, so you need stateful
IPv4 allocation. There's no one solution that meets all needs. First is the timing. Hopefully,
as we further into the future, the need for IPv4 addresses will decline. CPE devices have to 
use PD. That part is not optional. What you don't get is a dynamically allocated address.
And if you need to configure additional IPv4 parameters, that comes for free here with DHCPv4 server.
Ian: In the latest experiments we found that having dynamic allocation is a nice thing to have.
Rajiv: It may be a DNS proxy. Perhaps we could have a flag that says if we want to do dynamic allocation?
Kim: There's the draft that Ian proposed with 3 cases. Do you want to pick one of those 3 cases?
Ted: No. Ian is just innocent bystander. He wrote the draft as a favor for me. This is not
just about unified CPE. This is something that is happening in Softwires, so it motivates
us, but it is not the only reason. 
Kim: One of the options discussed was porting v4 options to v6, one by one. This is clearly a
non-starter.
Ted: So it's either approach 1 or 3. The third option is a tunnel. I think tunnel is a wrong
thing to do. Tunnel do not support all the things that are needed. And unnumbered tunnels
are not really tunnels.
Kim: so it's mostly the first solution.
Ted: We had couple discussions. First is to when you have initial DHCPv6 configuration, you may
also get an IPv6 address of the DHCPv4 server, and then you do something DHCPv4-like to 
DHCPv4 server over IPv6. The other thing that you could do, which actually has some attractive
positive quality, is that you can define a new DHCPv4 relay message option in DHCPv6 and
the client multicasts DHCPv6 message with DHCPv4 message in it to all v6 servers and v6 relays.
It will also likely reach the same server as regular DHCPv6 packets would do.
Kim: I haven't been following all the drafts in that area recently. Is there a draft that
explains that?
Ted: No. We came up with the draft recenly brainstorming. Does anybody think this is a bad idea?
Ole: can you state is again, please?
Ted: What we are proposing here is we have either relay-forw message (maybe relay-forw4 message)
that has relay-msg4 option inside it, following the same structure as relayed DHCPv6. The big
picture is that you essentially have one infrastructure that's delivering both DHCPv4 and DHCPv6
messages that arrive at the same destination point. At the end you decide to have either one
server or two.
Rajiv: The downside is that you have modify a relay.
Ted: Only the PE relay.
Bernie: and you need to change the server. There's a question about if we want to use existing
message type of something new.
Ted: Speaking of which, do we have a volunteer to write a draft?
[Tomek volnteering].
Ted: You're the chair...
Tomek: Am I still allowed to write drafts?
(laughs)
Rajiv: Are we still requiring server modification?
Ted: yes, but it is very localized.
Bernie: Let's take this to the list. We should write something short that explains the basic
concepts. Is there anyone that would like to write a draft?
Ian: we have different solutions draft? Would it make sense to have short description there?
Ted: No. It needs to be completed and document what we have agreed here. It will refer to the
solution.
Ian: That's a work item that is blocking several other Softwire works. We don't need it published
as RFC, we just need a decision.
Ole: I think is a grand idea for now, but I reserve my right to change my mind tomorrow. Would
it be easier to deploy if you colocate DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 servers?
Ted: Like Cisco and Nominum do?
Suresh Krishnan: The other solutions have something written down. We're talking about very fuzzy
things. I volunteer to work on this.
Marcin Siodelski: I think it is a good idea to document that, so I volunteer to do the job.
Ted: Allright! Does anyone want to work with him?
Bernie: I'll work with him, also Tomek will help.
