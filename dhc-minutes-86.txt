minutes written after meeting based on audio logs
and notes. Please excuse any inaccuracies

Agenda bashing: Ole Troan requested moving his presentation up to other
presentations about DHCPv4-over-IPv6 and chairs did that.

Chairs update:
Ted Lemon stepped down as DHC chair and taking over as Internet Area Director
John Brzozowski steppedn down as DHC chair and taking over as v6ops WG co-chair

New co-chairs:
Bernie Volz
Tomek Mrugalski

Ralph Droms (stepping down Internet AD) thanked both old chairs for a long,
effective service and welcomed new chairs.

New RFCs published:
- RFC6853 "DHCPv6 Redundancy Considerations"
- RFC6842 "Client Identifier Option in DHCP Server Replies"

Drafts in IESG:
- draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-bulk-leasequery (waiting for ref)
- draft-ietf-dhc-relay-id-suboption (approved)

- draft-ietf-dhc-host-gen-id-05 & draft-ietf-dhc-cga-config-dhcpv6-04
  authors asked if there is still interest in this work? No comments from WG,
  will take to the list, but likely drop

Potential WG items:
- draft-bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix-04 (author would like WG to adopt,
  on agenda)

- draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration-01 (updated, based on WG comments, on agenda)
- draft-mrugalski-softwire-dhcpv4-over-v6-option-01 (companion document for
  draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6-05, adopt or drop depending on discussion)

There is a planned joint DHC/sunset4 session planned in Berlin to discuss
issues that overlap Sunset4 and DHC. (Sunset4 and DHC will have separate
sessions as well)

IPR Disclosure
by Ted Lemon

Ted: Important procedural thing to be aware of. Announcing that there was a late
IPR disclosure.  In 2008 first secure-dhcpv6 draft was published. In 2010 there
was a patent filed. The IPR was disclosed in 2013 after WGLC. That is not ok
according to BCP79. IETF participants are required to required to disclose IPR
as soon as they are aware of any IP claims. The section chosen is a formal
notification sent to the list.

DHCP Directorate
by Ted Lemon

Ted: The issue is that DHC is an attractive place for people defining options
that have really nothing to do with DHCP. This often forces the WG to take up
the work that is not really DHCP. The proposal is to take it off the charter.
The DHC will no longer produce DHCP options. The work would be done in the
respective WGs. For example DHCP option for PCP is done in PCP WG. DHC is going
to do only protocol extensions. We're going to form DHCP Directorate - a
collection of experts that will help AD, mostly by doing review for DHCP related
work in other WGs. Architectural questions remain in DHC (option guidelines,
leasequery, failover, DHCPv4-over-IPv6 etc.). Chairs will propose DHCP
Directorate charter. Ted will be responsible for nominating members of DHCP
Directorate.

Bernie Volz: Maybe call it DHCP Options Directorate?
Ted: No, it may be for other things, not just options.
Kim Kinnear: Directorate not a bad idea in general, but there will be an overlap
between WG and directorate.
Ted: One of the major reasons for having WG is to form a consensus. Directorate
is more about technical review than consensus.
Kim: Would you expect more than one person to do review?
Ted: There may be couple people requested to do review.
Kim: My concern is that if we decide to solve a problem and the problem is not
protocol specific, what do we do?
Ted: Give me an example?
Kim: I don't have one right now. New suboption for option 82 for example.
Ted: If there is no WG that is appropriate and there's a genuine need for it,
we have liason statement from cablelabs or something like that.
Kim: What if we 12 people decide in this room that we need an option?
Ted: Good question. If there's 12 people interested, there are 2 options. The
first one is to create new charter, the second is to form a new WG. Another
way is to go to your AD and do individual submission and go straight to IESG.
Kim: In that case I object. I think this is a bad idea.
Bernie: We'll take it to the list.
Sheng Jiang: There is another scenario in IETF - do gap analysis or requirements
document. What if DHC gets a requirements document from some other WG. Would it
be ok to do this work in DHC?
Ted: No. This is an attractive nuisance. The whole point is to remove that
attractive nuisance.
Sheng: In the ops group expresses a need for an option to handle some
operational scenario, where should the work go?
Ted: That's a good point. I don't have an answer for that right now. I probably
need to discuss this with Ralph Droms. If it were completely up to me, I'd say
wait for a case like that and then decide, but I hear you. This is a legitimate
concern. Let me think about that.

Obtaining IPv4 Parameters in IPv6 Networks
by Ted Lemon
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration-01
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-dhc-dhcpv4-over-ipv6-05
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-sun-dhc-dhcpv6-opt-v4config-00

Bernie: We'd like to take up only couple clarifying questions, Ian will present
next on similar topic and Ole will do his. After that we'll have a broader
discussion later.

Suresh Krishnan: It is difficult to foresee how many options will be needed in
the next 10 or 20 years.

Rajiv: I just wanted to clarify that MAP-E was presented. It is not just the
part of PD used to derive IPv4 address, but also IPv4 prefix is provisioned.

draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration
Ian Farrer
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-rajtar-dhc-v4configuration-01
http://tools.ietf.org/agenda/86/slides/slides-86-dhc-4.pptx

Ian presented 3 different approaches discussed in the draft: DHCPv4-over-IPv6,
DHCPv6 and hybrid approach (DHCPv6 to get IPv4 address and then request any
other IPv4 options using DHCPINFORM over softwire tunnel).
