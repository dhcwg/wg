Dynamic Host Configuration Working Group
Chairpersons: Ralph Droms/UMD and Phill Gross/NRI
CHARTER
Description of Working Group:
The purpose of this working group is the investigation of
network configuration and reconfiguration management. We
will determine those configuration functions that can be
automated, such as Internet address assiglnment, gateway
discovery and resource location, and that which cannot
(i.e., those that must be managed by network
administrators).
Objectives:
0 We will identify (in the spirit of the Gateway
Requirements and Host Requirements RFCs) the
information required for hosts and gateways to:
a) Exchange Internet packets with other hosts (e.g.~
discover own Internet address)..
b) Obtain packet routing information (e.g., discover
local gateways).
c) Access the Domain Name System (e.g., discover
DNS server).
.
o
.
d) Access other local and remote services.
We will summarize those mechanisms already in place for
managing the information identified by objective I.
We will suggest new mechanisms to manage the
information identified by objective i.
Having established what information and mechanisms are
required for host operation, we will examine specific
scenarios of dynamic host configuration and
reconfiguration, and show how those scenarios can be
resolved using existing or proposed management
mechanisms.
Estimated Timeframe for Completion: (to be determined)
