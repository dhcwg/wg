  The dhc working group (DHC WG) has developed DHCP for automated 
  allocation, configuration and management of IP addresses and TCP/IP 
  protocol stack parameters. DHCPv4 is currently a "Draft Standard" and 
  is documented in RFC 2131 and RFC 2132. DHCPv6 is currently a 
  "Proposed Standard" and is documented in RFC 3315. Subsequent RFCs 
  document additional options and other enhancements to the 
  specifications.

  The DHC WG is responsible for defining DHCP protocol extensions.
  Definition of new DHCP options that are delivered using standard
  mechanisms are not considered a protocol extension and thus are
  outside of scope for DHC WG. Such options should be defined within
  their respective WGs and reviewed by the DHCP Directorate. However,
  if such options require protocol extensions, the protocol extension
  work must be done in the DHC WG.

  The DHC WG will only work on DHCPv4 when it is useful to support
  transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6.

  The DHC WG has the following main objectives:
  
  * Develop extensions to the DHCPv6 infrastructure as required to meet
  new applications and deployments of DHCP. The topics currently 
  in development are:
  
  - DHCPv6 Failover, High Availability and Load Balancing
  - DNS Update strategies for delegated prefixes (draft-ietf-dhc-dns-pd)
  - Extend DHCPv6 to work with multiple provisioning domains
  - DHCP provisioning of IPv4 clients over IPv6 networks
  - SOLMAXRT counter update
  - Container option 
  - Address Network Identifier (draft-ietf-dhc-access-network-identifier)
  - New NTP option to replace OPTION_NTP_SERVER (RFC 5908)
  - Prefix coloring (draft-bhandari-dhc-class-based-prefix)

  Additional topics may only be added with approval from the responsible
  Area Director or by rechartering.

  * Specify guidelines for creating new DHCPv6 options.

  * Develop documents that help explain operational considerations for
    the wider community.

  * Advance DHCPv6 (RFC 3315) along the IETF Standards Track. This will
  include writing analyses, corrections, and clarification of the DHCPv6
  specifications, including RFC 3315, RFC3633, RFC3736 and other RFCs
  defining additional options, which identifies ambiguities,
  contradictory specifications and other obstacles to development of
  interoperable implementations.
